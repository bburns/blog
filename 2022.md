# Summer 2022

## Austin to Sulphur Springs, TX

We wound up mostly being in the car from 12:30 to 7:30 - too much! 

Salado was a really cool art town - lots of old buildings, galleries etc. 

Veered off I35 around Waco and went through small towns, out of curiosity. But in hindsight staying on I35 would have been better - the towns were kind of rundown and depressing, and in between was just farmland and trees, not very scenic tho. 

We did stop at a park NE of Waco and let Zoey out to stretch - it was a huge park on a lake, would have been nice to camp and swim.

Zoey was not crazy about being outside, mainly because it was so hot out.

Found a nice Hampton Inn in Sulphur Springs. 

## Sulphur Springs to Hot Springs, AR

Drove towards Texarcana, tried to find a decent McDonalds but the one was saw looked sketchy.

DeGrey Lake was huge and gorgeous, with low hills and trees - and no houses on it!

## Hot Springs to Fairfield Bay
